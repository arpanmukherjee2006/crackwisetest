A better candidate: isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) is C5H8 but has two double bonds. For single double bond candidate with symmetric allylic positions giving single product: 2-methyl-2-butene? That's C5H10 (wrong). Exhaustive reasoning shows plausible structure: 2-pentene where allylic position at C3 unique? This is complex.
